This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Data available

- Countries
- Competitions
- Events
- Markets
- Runners

# Proposed Next Steps

1. Event filter (where I can filter for a team/selection name)
2. Data refresh button
3. Automated data refresh every 20 seconds
4. Betpocket (top right corner)
  Every time I click on a bet, the bet is added to the betpocket.
  Then, on the betpocket I add the stake (money) and place the bet.
5. Event page
